<p>I've decided to start anew! 
In this story I will be talking about my second job, delivering pizzas. 
This may seem like a simple job to someone who has never worked in delivery, however, 
on top of delivering pizza you must also learn how to do everyone else's jobs.
This is because you aren't always going to be delivering non-stop and corporate doesn't 
want you to just sit around getting paid to do nothing so you help out where you can.

Enjoy!</p>
